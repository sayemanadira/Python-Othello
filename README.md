Our game is the text-based board game, Othello. Othello has similar pieces as checkers. The only two rules of the game are that two pieces of the same color must surround pieces of the opposite color to change and second, every move must flip the opponent's piece. We thought of Othello because we were thinking of the iMessage game called Reversie, which is Othello in the iPhone. We enjoyed the game so much so that we decided to recreate the game into Python. Our initial thoughts about this project is that we had an idea of the main functions due to its main two rules that is fundemantally integrated for the whole game. Due to these main functions and our experience in creating the Connect4 text-based game in Python, we felt confident that we can create Othello into python.
